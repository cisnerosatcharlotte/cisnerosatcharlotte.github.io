McCullough Station is a stop at University City; it’s clean, portrays art, and has many seats and access to the street. The station is on Tryon Street, and there you can see several ads for diverse products and services. McCullough Station is accessible as it has ramps for people with disabilities, and you can enter directly from the street; however, to go to the bus stop, you need to walk on the sidewalk, and there is no direct access. McCullough Station portraits art by Shaun Cassidy and Darren Goins closer to the bike parking. Susan Brenner’s art can be found close to the stairs and Carolyn Braaksma’s on walls and bridges. 
This station looks like many others. There are signs that people with auditory disabilities can use, or automated voice messages announcing when the train is arriving or departing, as well as the final destination for each train. Some amenities are two ticket vending machines accepting cash, coins, and cards, and covered seats to protect you from rain and snow; some even have a lateral cover against the wind, and others are in the open. McCullough Station is vital as it connects people with the public transportation system in Charlotte. There are many businesses and housing in this area, which is why it is helpful for people to move around the city. McCullough Station is the third stop of the light rail, followed by University City. 
McCullough Station opened its doors on March 16th, 2018, and was part of the UNC Charlotte campus extension. This public station connects chains and restaurants like iHop, Burger King, and Showmars. There is also a restaurant called Papi’s Puerto Rican Cuisine which serves authentic Puerto Rican food. The owners are from Puerto Rico, and the restaurant serves as a meeting point for Puerto Ricans and other Latinos in the community. Lodging options include places like Hampton Inn, Extended Stay America, and Country Inn. As for health services, you can find a Walgreens closer to the station, CSL Plasma for those wanting to donate plasma, Carolina Digestive Health Associates, and Atrium Health Hospital. The hospital is farther from the station, but it’s within walking distance if you are up for that. Other stores are Verizon, FedEx, and Mavis Tires & Brakes.
