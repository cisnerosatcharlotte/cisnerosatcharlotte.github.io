Tom Hunter station opened in March of 2018 as part of the Blue Light Rail. It is located in the Hidden Valley neighborhood at 6506 North Tryon Street. Tom Stanley designed the public art project for the station. He based his design idea on Hidden Valley Elementary School and Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School. The works of art near the station are centered around "home," as the Hidden Valley neighborhood is the home of many families that have lived there for generations. This station has a modern style, with only an island platform. The station has a gazebo and benches covered with blue themed art for the passengers. The station has garbage and recycling containers to keep the station fresh and clean. It is worth mentioning that the announcements for all stations, Tom Hunter included, are in both languages, English and Spanish!
