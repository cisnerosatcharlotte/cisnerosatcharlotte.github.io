Charlotte’s Light Rail is integral to the communities inside of and surrounding the city. I-485 Station is the last stop south of the Light Rail and the final stop of the entire 18.9 miles. This area is essential not only to the residents of the surrounding neighborhoods but also to residents of southern regions such as Pineville, Ballantyne, Matthews, and border towns in the northern part of South Carolina. 
Resources and services found around the station include fast-food restaurants, gas stations, and renowned automobile dealerships. Apart from this, there are small shops and entertainment venues; two neighborhoods- Sterling and Pine Valley- host residents living close by. These resources and services in the area are vital to boost the economy near the station. It would be safe to assume that many Hispanics from around live, eat, work, shop, and plan at the same places. Carolina Place Mall, in Pineville, is also a store serving Hispanics in the area. Even though it is closer to Pineville City, Pineville Medical Center is the nearest hospital serving the community. I-485 Station is where people, especially Spanish speakers, gather to help one another in the community.
Initially, the location of the train was set to be 1.5 miles south of the current location, but this changed because the administration thought the Sterling area should be the last landmark. With this in mind, Charlotte City decided to make the light rail station more accessible by building a vast parking lot with space for 1,120 vehicles, and the upper portion serves as a playground for Sterling Elementary School. Additionally, there is a bicycle rack. 
Charlotte City wanted the train station to be accessible. This is why they built a path connecting the Sterling neighborhood, the train station, with the parking lot open 24/7, and you can leave your car in 24 hours. The light rail station looks clean, as it is expected for passengers to enjoy the experience. One final addition is the art visible all throughout the station.
