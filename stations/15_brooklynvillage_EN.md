Brooklyn Village station was initially called Stonewall, but on Thursday, June 30th, 2022, the station's name changed to Brooklyn Village. This was a neighborhood of African-American people destroyed in 1970, and Brooklyn Town Station, once called Stonewall Station, is in the second quadrant of the city. Brooklyn Town is a historic area in Charlotte as it was at one time a predominantly African-American neighborhood. It's a gentrified community, which has been an ongoing movement since the first wave of "urban renewal," which took place during the 1960s and 1970s. It is symbolic of the affordable housing problem in Charlotte.
Brooklyn Village station has many things for public transportation users. The station has plenty of seats for people waiting for the train; there is a ticket vending machine that has the text in Spanish, and the announcements about the train are in English and Spanish. 
The station is located above the parking deck of the Westin. The station is next to the housing system, the Westin Hotel, and the Convention Center. There is a water fountain, and under the station, under the stairs, there are many shops where people can buy food, for example, at the supermarket Whole Foods, which has a public restroom as well. The station has many sidewalks, which are very wide, making the station accessible for people in wheelchairs. The station has a bicycle parking lot as well.
Brooklyn Village is close to the NASCAR Hall of Fame, which is a museum that welcomes family members of all ages. There is a Farmers Market that sells produce from farms to consumers and a full Food Market with a buffet, pizzeria, bakery, and bar; it even has a parking garage. There are beauty salons, such as Jolie Boutique Salon and Cachet Nail Shop. It has many apartment complexes, such as The Francis, Uptown 550, and Savoy, and has hotels ready for a short stay, such as The Hilton Garden Hotel, Embassy Suites, The Westin, and the JW Marriott. There are not many bike lanes in Brooklyn Village, but there are plenty of connections to public buses, street parking meters, and parking garages. The area has some advanced trash and recycling containers along the large and wide sidewalks with many storm drains and buildings with public water stations.
