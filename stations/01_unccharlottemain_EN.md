The LYNX Blue Line connects UNC Charlotte with neighbors and commercial districts from University City to Uptown and the south- almost to the border with Pineville County. The light rail brings more accessibility for citizens of the region to university resources. UNC Charlotte Main Station is located next to Cameron Boulevard on Wallis Hall (close to North Deck) and has parkings close by. The train station has covered seats, two ticket vending machines with audio and braille options, and a bike rack. UNC Charlotte students have free access to these services linked to their ID student cards; faculty can also purchase a pass through the UNC Charlotte website. 

In 2005, the university entered into an agreement with the city government to bring the light rail to campus. The Blue Line extension opened on March 16th, 2018; on that day, the inaugural train departed from UNC Charlotte-Main. One month prior, a ribbon cut ceremony had taken place to celebrate university participation in the light rail project. This station is important for the light rail as it represents a connection between the university students and faculty and other areas of Charlotte City. UNC Charlotte-Main is located on campus, and as such the surrounding area is dedicated to students and faculty.

Many resources and services are available for Spanish speakers at the University of Charlotte which is within walking distance from the train station. There is a free bus service available for students and visitors; there is also a shuttle available for students to do their shopping- those outside the Niner community cannot use the shuttle without a UNCC student. The shuttle travels to three locations: a Hindu supermarket, called Patel Brothers; another supermarket called Harris Teeter; and a store called Target. There are several ATMs around campus at the University of Charlotte, and they allow you to choose Spanish. 

Several organizations that promote Hispanic community bonds on campus, as well as clubs that strengthen Spanish learners’ skills. Here is a list of all Hispanic and Latino/a/x organizations:
