Opened in November 2007, the Scaleybark station is located on South Blvd, south of the city of Charlotte. At the stop you can find cobblestones, shelter windshields and a column cladding inspired by Mexican Bingo cards, made by Leticia Huerta. The cards include a crown as a tribute to the Queen City- this is what we call the city, in honor of Queen Charlotte of England, wife of King George III.
This train stop has connections to the county bus system (CATS.) The connections available at the stop are for bus routes 12 and 30. These connections are very important because bus route 12 runs from the south of the Queen City, to highway I-85, whose freeway runs around the city of Charlotte, forming a loop. Route 30 is also quite important. Route 30 runs from east to west, intersecting the Scaleybark stop about the middle. This route is extremely important because it connects people who live near the Southpark Mall to Highway I-85, which runs north and west from Charlotte.
The Scaleybark stop is close to an important office for Charlotte Latinos: the Charlotte Latin American Chamber of Commerce. The Latin American Charlotte Chamber of Commerce is a non-profit organization that provides resources for Spanish-speaking people, including educational programs: Latino Leadership Development Institute (LLDI), the Economic Development Initiative for Business Owners, and Cultivating Talent, which is an initiative that seeks to develop a pathway for the economic development of youth. In the same building there is a center for entrepreneurs called Prospera.
Scaleybark station has many services close by; some only accessible for cars.  For example, there is a repair shop, a car dealership, a car trailer, and a tire store. The area also has a lot of entertainment and restaurants where Spanish is spoken. There are available apartments, east of the station, further away from services and available resources.
