This station contains many things to see and do. There are bicycle racks, lights, an ADA walkway for people with disabilities, seats, a phone booth for emergency calls, and public art. The art in the park is beautiful. The contrast between white seats, white covers, and blue windows gives off the fresh feeling of South America.
The station is close to 9th Street, where walkways link all the way to Charlotte's "Blue Light Rail Line." One can easily walk from the station to UNC Charlotte Dubois Center. The station has many works of art and the first neighborhood park. Many apartments are near the station,  such as the Ellis, First Ward Place, Ellis Midrise, and Uptown Gardens apartment complexes. There are many restaurants, such as Mad Dash, Sabor Latin Grill, and Duckworth's Grill & Taphouse. There are also places such as Charlotte's Ballet Academy, the Academy of Creative Arts of the first neighborhood park, and the McColl Center. 
The station was designed by Anna Valentina Murch and her husband, Douglas Hollis, as part of the program "CATS Art in Transit." Mrs. Murch was a sculptor who specialized in environmental art, with close to 30 public art projects, and many prizes from the "Public Art Network'' and the "National Arts Foundation." The station was inaugurated on June 28th, 2004, for the "Charlotte Trolley."
