Bland Station opened on November 24, 2007, and is part of the original run of the Blue Light Rail route. This station is accessed through sidewalks; it has two platforms with six covered waiting areas with benches; it also has ticket vending machines, an emergency call service, and a bike rack. This station has very good lighting and ramps access for people with disabilities. The announcements are in English and Spanish with a Spanish accent.
In this station are several art pieces, including bronze pieces created by the artist [Yuriko Yamaguchi](https://yurikoyamaguchi.com/public-art/) called Dream Keeper, a drinking fountain designed by [Nancy Blum](http://nancyblum.com/) that reflects the North Carolina state flower, dogwood. There's also art by Alice Adams, [Leticia Huerta](http://www.leticiahuerta.com/), Hoss Haley, and Shaun Cassidy.
Near that station are many restaurants, and new apartment buildings, mostly for housing rather than offices. Many people walk their dogs, walk or run, and you can also ride electric bicycles and electric scooters.
Within walking distance is [The Charlotte Urban Design Center](https://www.charlottenc.gov/Growth-and-Development/Planning-and-Development/Planning/Urban-Design). This is a space to engage the community in urban design. In this center, residents, artists, and community organizations have access to information and resources about the urban planning and designs of the city of Charlotte. There is also the contemporary art gallery [Elder Gallery](https://eldergalleryclt.com/). In this gallery, you can see already established and emerging artists who challenge traditional materials and aesthetic and invite critical thinking.
