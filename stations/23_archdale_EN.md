Archdale station is at the intersection of South Blvd and Archdale streets, which are two roads with high intensity daily traffic. When arriving at the station, you will notice several resources that are accessible to Spanish speakers and Latinos within an appropriate walking distance. Some of the public resources include the post office and the DMV office. Other beneficial resources offering services in Spanish are a laundromat, an international supermarket called Compare Foods, a mechanic, as well as several apartments in this area, but not all of them are affordable for the population. As a personal note, there is no access for cyclists to ride their bikes on safe sidewalks because there is no bike lane. Around the station, on high traffic streets, you can find pedestrian traffic lights that contribute to the safety of the population nearby. On the main street, there are several private car dealerships, one of the biggest being Depo Auto Care.
There are services and resources that were not offered in Spanish, but are within an accessible distance of the Archdale station. In this spot, there are thrift stores available that do not appear to offer services in Spanish. The state of the environment at the station is more or less acceptable due to all the garbage that can be seen lying on the street- though the area also contains several garbage and recycling cans.
