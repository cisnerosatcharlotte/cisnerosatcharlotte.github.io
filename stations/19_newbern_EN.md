This station opened in November 2007 and is part of the original Blue Light Rail route. The station serves Sedgefield, Southside Park, and South End neighborhoods. This station has two platforms and is accessed through sidewalks. The platforms have six covered seats, a ticket vending machine, bicycle racks, and announcements in English and Spanish. It has good lighting and an emergency call service. The platforms are easily accessible to people with disabilities.
The artists who worked on this station are Hoss Haley, who contributed a stone bench, River Rock. Alice Adams, Nancy Blum, Shaun Cassidy, and Leticia Huerta also participated. A cube-shaped sculpture created with Pepsi cans stands out as a reminder of the old Pepsi drink bottling complex that existed in this area between 1966 and 2015. This sculpture was made by Ivan Depe침a.
It is a station that clearly shows the impact of  gentrification on the city of Charlotte. Before, it was just single-family homes, and now it is full of housing complexes. You can also see a proliferation of breweries, restaurants, bars, and commercial stores.
