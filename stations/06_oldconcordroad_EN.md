Old Concord station is located in the Newell Community along the northeastern of Mecklenburg County, more precisely in the intersection between Old Concord Road and Tryon and it can be accessed by car through the Pumpernickel Rd. It is well lit on both sides of the platform as well as on the parking lots; it is very clean and has announcements in two languages, English and Spanish. The station has benches covered with green pillars along the northbound side and yellow along the southbound. It also has a colorful bike rack. The station has garbage and recycling receptacles to keep the station fresh and clean. It is worth mentioning that the station platform has access for people with disabilities or strollers for children. The artist featured in this station is Chandra Cox, who worked along with Carolyn Braaksma, Susan Brenner y Darren Going. Since adding this station to the line, the surrounding area has grown immensely; and it is important to highlight that this station is home to one of the few free parking lots and it is also close to several businesses such as Primos Tire Shop or Super Wash Lavandería.
