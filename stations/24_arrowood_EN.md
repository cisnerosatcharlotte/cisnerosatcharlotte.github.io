This station is next to South Blvd, a low income area where you can see the impact of gentrification. While leaving Arrowood station, you can see many available stores for Spanish speakers, mostly small and family businesses, as well as some large corporations. The station is next to a busy street which makes walking a bit dangerous; there are sidewalks, but with limited access. There are also be found small businesses, where Spanish is spoken; the closest being a pawnshop, a mattress store, the Hispanic supermarket Compare Foods, a gas station, a beauty parlor, a community bank and a Mexican restaurant called Mi tierra- all walking distance from the station for those with no access to other means of transport. An important detail is that sidewalks and roads are not well kept and the landscape needs maintenance. Some resources and services that are not available in this area are recycling bins; it is very common to see trash on the floor, causing a health issue to people and nature in the area.
