East/West Blvd station is called the South End of Charlotte. The waiting areas to catch the train are covered, there is a water fountain, seats, a wheelchair-accessible platform, automatic audio announcements in English and Spanish, bike racks, and it is well-lit at night. CATS bus connections are Route 10 and Route 25. It also has beautiful public art and tree landscaping. The station was created in 1996 as a heritage tram stop for the Charlotte Trolley. In 2007, it was reincorporated as a stop for the light rail. The area called Charlotte's South End was created in 1850 and stopped progressing in the 1970s and 1980s, becoming an area known for abandoned buildings. When the station was transformed in 2007, Charlotte's South End also began to transform; there was a lot of development, including design districts and Atherton Mills. In 2018, the area was named America's fastest-growing submarket for apartment growth; it is very pretty and busy. The neighborhood has many traditions, such as going shopping on Saturdays, watching movies in the Wilmore Centennial Park, or cleaning the sidewalks near the train. The area has numerous restaurants and shops within walking distance. From the station, you can walk to Parque Latta. It has trails for walking, soccer fields, tennis, basketball, and volleyball courts. The community also has a farmer's market every Saturday.
Near the train station, there is an emergency clinic and several gyms to care for your health. The clinic is part of Atrium Health, and they have access to Spanish language interpreters and translators. There are many banks near the train; Truist, Fifth Third, Truliant, and more; those banks have people who speak Spanish as well. Within a five-minute walk, you can find Publix and Harris Teeter supermarkets. It is quite easy to cross the street, and there are sidewalks everywhere. If you want to walk or ride a bike, there is a cycle path called "Rail Trail." The bike path is more than five kilometers, and you can find more restaurants, shops, and art. Public transportation is quite common here, and you can go visit other parts of the city whenever you want. During the day, it is easier to use public transport or walk in this part because there is a lot of traffic and driving here can be stressful. The main street is called South Boulevard, a trendy street in Charlotte. South Boulevard has sidewalks on both sides, and you can find something to do wherever you walk. In this area, it is very common to work from home, but there are also many jobs in companies as well. Many young people and families are living in the apartments near this station, and it is an area that seems to have the potential to grow even more.
