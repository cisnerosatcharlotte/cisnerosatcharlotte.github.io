Sharon Road West is the second to the last station, and it is an original part of the LYNX Blue Line light rail planning. It opened in November 2007 and is in the industrial area of Montclaire South. The station entrance is on Crump Street, which can be accessed from South Blvd by car through the bridge leading to the Snyder's-Lace factory's gate. A pedestrian bridge also connects directly to the intersection of South Blvd and Sharon Rd West; this intersection has pedestrian walk and sound signals for the visually impaired. It also has an elevator for people in wheelchairs.
The station has a platform and four shelters; there are also benches to sit on while waiting. This station has two ticket vending machines, an emergency call service, and bicycle racks. This station has a parking lot and a bus stop for CATS lines 19, 43, and 55. The parking lot is normally used by commuters who work in the center to the north of the university.
The artists who worked on this station are Marek Ranis, who worked on bridges and walls, Alice Adams on the sidewalks; Nancy Blum who contributed to the drinking fountain and Leticia Huerta on the covered spaces and columns.
