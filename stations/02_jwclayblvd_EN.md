J.W. Clay Station is located Northeast of Charlotte, on the city’s outskirts. The station is opposite the Marriott Hotel, right next to the university. J.W Clay Station is great for attending the games on campus; on the opposite side of the road, there is a mall with several businesses like supermarkets, banks, clothing stores, hair salons, a church, and a post office. J.W Clay Station is an indispensable part of Charlotte’s tourism as well as essential services for citizens. Touristic landmarks, services and essential businesses are located along Tryon Street. American football games and the hotel lure tourists, fans and university visitors to the station. 
On the other hand, Charlotte residents can pop by the station for chores or recreational activities as there are plenty of restaurants with a wide variety of food, a footbridge, and university walking routes. Even though essential services and tourist places are accessible to Spanish speakers, smaller places like some restaurants and companies don’t have Spanish speakers. 
The developer for what we see today was a geographer called Jim Clay, who had an idea for the city of Charlotte- so ahead of his time, some say. In 1979, the city looked crooked as most of the infrastructure was located towards the south, closer to South Carolina. No one wanted to travel northeast of Charlotte as there were no services, but this was the result of few residents in the area to justify the development thereof. Consequently, Clay met the Carley Capital Group and began planning “University Place,” which was finalized in 1985.  The main concept was having a walking area with stores and restaurants and lots of open spaces. Unfortunately, Carley went bankrupt, and the project was taken over by another company. Even with a different view, a new crowd was lured northeast- as originally planned by Clay. Mr. J.W. Clay died of  lung cancer in 1994, but he is still remembered for the station named in his honor.
