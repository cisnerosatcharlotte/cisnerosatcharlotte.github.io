Created in 2018, University City Blvd is located on North Tryon Street, a well-organized and beautiful area with new clean green sidewalks, trees, and grass surrounding the station. Streets around the station are filled with traffic, which hinders safety when walking. The station platform has access for people with disabilities, and pedestrian crossings have signs and clear signals informing people when it is safe to cross. Since adding this station to the line, the surrounding area has grown immensely; more and more businesses have opened, primarily closer to the shopping center near Ikea. The station is a great representation of how much Charlotte's University area has grown. Around the station, you may find many neighborhoods, quality apartments, and some new buildings are always being developed. The station is integral for UNC Charlotte students due to its closeness to the city and the university. In half an hour, a passenger can get to Uptown Charlotte; in twenty minutes, one can get to UNC Charlotte. University City Blvd Station has bus connections with routes 11, 50, and 54.
At the station, all signs to fare zones and information on how to buy a ticket can be found in Spanish. Apart from this, there are signs and automated announcements in both English and Spanish, notifying passengers of the train's arrival; it is worth mentioning that the variety of Spanish is from Spain. Close to the station, several services exist for the Hispanic community- or offered by them- such as the "Camino Health Clinic," whose mission is to support the Latin American community and other minorities. This clinic provides mental and healthcare, a food pantry, and many other family opportunities like free entrepreneurial courses and Zumba classes for kids. On top of these services is a law firm called "Estudio Jurídico Latorre." Food-wise, you can find a food court; for clothes, there are affordable options like The Warehouse. Finally, there is a church called Iglesia Cristiana Pentecostal Montesinai.
