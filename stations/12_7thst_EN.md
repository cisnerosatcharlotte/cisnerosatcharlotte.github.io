This train station is called "7th Street Train Station," and it is located in the center of the city. It is a very important station for the inhabitants due to its location in the city's center and is connected to the CTC and 9th Street stations. It is one of the original stations that opened in 2007. This area is a large space where many people come to work in different locations, such as banks, technology companies, and many other companies that are important to the Charlotte economy. The station is connected to a parking garage and a market, and this is important because it opens up the rest of the city to people who come to the city center. Other crucial things are the available bicycles for rent, cycle paths, and water fountains. Bike lanes are important because a person can carry a bike on the train with them and utilize the on-board bike racks, so these lanes provide access to the train and vice versa, just like the train provides access to bike lanes to travel around the city. Water sources are important because it provides access to reliable and safe drinking water. Also, something very important for the station is that the roofs are available for people who want to use the train, although they are scarce.
