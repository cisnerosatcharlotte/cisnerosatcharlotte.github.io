This train station is called "7th Street Train Station," and it is located in the center of this city. It is a very important station for the inhabitants because it is located in the city's center and is connected to the CTC and 9th Street stations. It is one of the original stations that opened in 2007. This area is a large area where many people come to work in different locations, such as banks, technology companies, and many other companies that are important to the Charlotte economy. The station is connected to a parking garage and a market, and this is important because it opens up the rest of the city to people who come to the city center. Other crucial things are the possibilities to rent bicycles, cycle paths for people who drive bicycles, and water fountains. Bike lanes are important because a person can carry a bike because trains have bike racks, so these lines provide access to the train and vice versa, just like the train provides access to bike lanes to travel around the city. Water sources are important because it means that anyone can drink water. Also, something very important for the station is that the roofs are available for people who want to use the train, although they are scarce.
