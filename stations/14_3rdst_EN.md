The 3rd Street Station is one of the best stops to visit the heart of the city of Charlotte. It is at ground level and very accessible for people who use wheelchairs. You can enjoy a beautiful view of the city from below and above the station. This station is decorated with big red and green walls that were designed to protect people from the inclement weather while they wait for the train. This station also has an audio system with English and Spanish announcements that communicate when the train is coming.  At this station, you will find an entrance to the Hilton-Charlotte Center City Hotel. Nearby is where the Charlotte visitor center is located and you can find maps and information about the city. Something really special about this station is the fact that it is close to a beautiful park named Roman Bearden.  The park has a beautiful waterfall that lights up at night, and hidden benches that blend in with the trees. Next to the park and only two blocks from the station, you can find the historical  “Latta Arcade.” Full of restaurants, offices and small businesses. Inside “Latta Arcade” you can find restaurants that represent the Latino culture.  This little corner of Charlotte exhibits the different faces of a growing city.
