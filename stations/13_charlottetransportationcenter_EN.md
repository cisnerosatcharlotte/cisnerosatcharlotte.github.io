This station is called Charlotte Transportation Center, or CTC. This station has a waiting area covered with lights, ticket vending machines with passenger assistance, and an emergency telephone; there are also plenty of places to sit and automated audio announcements in English and Spanish. On top of this, the platform has access for people with disabilities, elevators, and bike racks. CTC Station has plenty to offer, like the many things listed above, and an easy connection to Charlotte Bus Station as well as to the heart of Uptown Charlotte. A lot of work was done towards the construction of this important and wonderful station. Many artists helped design certain parts of the platform. Shaun Cassidy designed the fence around the tracks, Alice Adams designed the low walls, and Nancy Blum designed the water fountains. These are just a few of the many great ways Charlotte chose local artists to help design and build such an enjoyable station. The station is built like a big bridge; underneath the platform, all the buses are parked- as the bus and train stations are integrated. CTC station is a central point for transportation in Charlotte, as it connects to the 7th Street Station and the 3rd Street Station. These stations also have many different options for exploring the city and also many opportunities to be a part of the Charlotte community.
You will see many significant buildings outside of the waiting area and Spectrum Stadium is located directly opposite the station. This stadium is the home of the NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets. The stadium is surrounded by large billboards of different Hornets players and posters of concerts that will take place in the stadium. Around the stadium, there are many other hotel buildings, such as the Hyatt Charlotte Hotel and the Ritz Carlton Hotel. The latter is a luxurious hotel that offers many types of rooms and lounges for tourists visiting the city or business people conducting business in the area. If you walk towards Trade Street, you will see the Epicenter, a huge shopping center full of restaurants, bars, and stores, which offer many food options, CVS for your healthcare needs, UPS access, and hotels that offer services in Spanish. Three blocks towards E.Trade Street is the collection of government buildings such as the Federal Reserve Bank, the Charlotte District Attorney's Office, and the Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office. In this area, you can find help with issues related to the law. 
Finally, if you walk towards S Brevard Street, you will come to the Nascar Hall of Fame Museum; it is right across from Buffalo Wild Wings and offers the history behind Nascar racing, as it's very popular here in Charlotte.
